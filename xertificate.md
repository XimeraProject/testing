A xourse is scored out of 100 based on the percentage of completion. 

A student may print a xertificate at any time. 

The student will then input the code into their LMS

Instructors can then take the list of codes, send it to ximera (as a csv 
file), and get a list of scores (as csv).

Instructors can then interpert the scores as they please
