%% Only students in a class can respond to topics, though anyone can
%% comment.

%% Picture answer is REQUIRED.

%% Maybe topic owner (the person who responds first) should recieve
%% emails when comments are made. 

%% Each response is editable. 

%% "thing-response" controls what is allowed for each topic in the
%% forum. So max-response=2, would mean that a forum topic has at
%% maximum, two top-level responses.

%% "required-thing" is something a student is required to do. The
%% number assigned to this is the number of "things" each student must
%% do.

%% max-response is the max number of top level responses for each
%% topic

%% required-votes is the number of votes each students is required to
%% give.

%% required-answers is the number of topics the student must provide
%% answers to.

%% votes require comments.

%% A student has completed their HW when they answer the number of
%% topics and complete their votes.

%% ANYONE should be able to vote (though still must comment) on
%% all questions.

%% A topic is not COMPLETE unless the majority of the votes are
%% up-votes.

%% Voting is not complete, unless you are voting with the majority. 

%% May lose history of comments - not a big deal.  EG: I write a
%% comment, with down-vote, then the answer is fixed, so I change the
%% down-vote to an up-vote, and give a new comment. ``Nice work!''

%% We probably need some way to email/contact/alert the user if the
%% status of a topic that they have either responded to, or commented
%% on, changes.

\begin{xorum}[max-response=1,required-answers=1,required-votes=10]
  \topic{What is $2+3$?}
  \topic{What is $4+3$?}
  \topic{What is $6+3$?}
\end{xorum}
